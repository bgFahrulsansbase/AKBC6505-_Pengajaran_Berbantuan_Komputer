<h1>Learning:</h1>

From Speculation to Science The  essence  of  matter,  the  origins  of  the  universe,  the  nature  of  the human mind—these are the profound questions that have engaged thinkers through the centuries.  Until quite recently, understanding the mind—and the thinking and learning that the mind makes possible—has remained an elusive quest, in part because of a lack of powerful research tools.  

> Esensi materi, asal-usul alam semesta, sifat pikiran manusia—ini adalah pertanyaan mendalam yang telah melibatkan para pemikir selama berabad-abad. Sampai baru-baru ini, memahami pikiran—dan pemikiran dan pembelajaran yang dimungkinkan oleh pikiran—tetap menjadi sebuah pencarian yang sulit dipahami, sebagian karena kurangnya alat penelitian yang kuat.

Today, the world is in the midst of an  xtraordinary outpouring of [scientific work]() on the mind and brain, on the processes of thinking and learning, on the neural processes that occur during thought and learning, and on the development of competence. 
 
> Hari Ini dunia berada di tengah-tengah pencurahan [karya ilmiah]() yang luar biasa pada pikiran dan otak, pada proses berpikir dan belajar, pada proses saraf yang terjadi selama berpikir dan belajar, dan pada pengembangan kompetensi.

The revolution in the study of the mind that has occurred in the last three or four decades has important implications for education.  As we illustrate, a new theory of learning is coming into focus that leads to very different approaches to the design of curriculum, teaching, and assessment than those often found in schools today.  Equally important, the growth of inter-
disciplinary inquiries and new kinds of scientific collaborations have begun


to  make  the  path  from  basic  research  to  educational  practice  somewhat
more visible, if not yet easy to travel.  Thirty years ago, educators paid little
attention to the work of cognitive scientists, and researchers in the nascent
field  of  cognitive  science  worked  far  removed  from  classrooms.    Today,
cognitive researchers are spending more time working with teachers, testing
and refining their theories in real classrooms where they can see how differ-
ent  settings  and  classroom  interactions  influence  applications  of  their
theories.

What is perhaps currently most striking is the variety of research approaches and techniques that have been developed and ways in which evi-  dence from many different branches of science are beginning to converge.
The story we can now tell about learning is far richer than ever before, and
it promises to evolve dramatically in the next generation.  For example:
